## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** with **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following structure:

```
/
├── index.html              # The main HTML file
├── README.md               # This file
└── assets/
    ├── css/
    │   └── style.css       # Custom styles
    └── js/
        ├── main.js         # Main entry point, event listeners
        ├── api.js          # Simulated data and state management
        ├── auth.js         # Authentication logic
        └── ui.js           # DOM manipulation, rendering, modals, toasts
```

## How to Run

Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No server is needed as this is a fully client-side application.
